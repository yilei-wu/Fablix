Optimization Methods
1. We first parse the xml files to csv files and store them
   in the project temporarily, then use LOAD FILE command in
   SQL to load them into database.
2. We used unique index on movies and genres to prevent duplicate
   entries, so that no sql queries is needed to be executed.
